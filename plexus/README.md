## Files

-   **gcn_conv.py**: This file implements a 3D tensor-parallel version of the `GCNConv` layer, a fundamental component in Graph Convolutional Networks.

-   **cross_entropy.py**: This file provides a parallel implementation of the cross-entropy loss function, a standard loss function used for node-level classification.

-   **utils**: This subdirectory contains several utility modules that provide essential functionalities for the Plexus framework:

    -   **general.py**: This module includes generic utility functions used throughout the framework, including the following.
        -   setting s random seed for reproducible experiments.
        -   padfinh a number to make it divisible by another number, which is helpful when sharding.
        -   functions for retrieving process group information
        -   functions for printing timing information

    -   **dataset.py**: This module provides utilities for preprocessing graph datasets. Key functions include:
        -   `preprocess_graph()`: Preprocesses a graph dataset.  This includes normalizing features and the adjacency matrix, and applying the double permutation scheme specific to Plexus.  It is recommended to use the `set_seed` function from `general.py` before calling this function, as random initialization is used for features in datasets that do not originally contain them.
        -   `partition_graph_2d()`: Statically 2D partitions a preprocessed graph, creating an individual file for each 2D matrix partition. This allows for distributing the data across multiple devices, preventing each GPU from having to load the entire dataset.
        -   Other utility functions for data conversion and manipulation.

    -   **dataloader.py**: This module contains the `DataLoader` class, which is responsible for efficiently loading preprocessed graph data. The `DataLoader` supports two modes:
        -   Loading unpartitioned (original) preprocessed data.
        -   Loading partitioned data generated by the `partition_graph_2d()` function. In this case, the `DataLoader` automatically determines which files to load for each GPU and extracts the relevant data shards.
